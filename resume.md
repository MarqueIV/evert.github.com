Other projects

### Blogging

I've been blogging on and off since 2006. Here's some of my favourites:

<ul>
{% for post in site.tags.featured %}
  <li>
     <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
     <span>({{ post.date | date:"%Y-%m-%d" }})</span>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

Because of this, I've been published in both PHP Architect (a paper PHP
magazine) and PHP Advent (now defunct series of articles).


### Ketting

In 2016 I started a new open-source project called
[Ketting](https://github.com/evert/ketting). This project is an opiniated REST
client, written in Javascript for both server and client side.

### Curveball

A also started [Curveball](https://curveballjs.org/), a modern Javascript
framework to replace Express.

### a12n-server

I built both a [OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server](https://github.com/curveball/a12nserver)
and an [OAuth2 Client](https://github.com/badgateway/oauth2-client).


### sabre.io

Since 2007 I started working on an open source library that would be named
sabre/dav. This project spawned a number of PHP libraries that are now widely
in use for various purposes. The project site is <http://sabre.io/>. I'm still
the lead maintainer for all of these projects.
