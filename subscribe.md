Subscribe
=========

To subscribe to this blog, you have several options.

The Atom Feed
-------------

The Atom feed is located at:

<https://evertpot.com/atom.xml>

If you are not familiar with Atom (or RSS), it's a simple XML format that
has lists recent updates and it's actually supported in many, many websites.

Almost every browser at one point had built-in support for feeds, but
unfortunately most popular browsers don't anymore. Despite that, Atom and RSS
feeds are still extremely well supported by content producers.  If you're
reading blogs or news sites today the chance is incredibly high that a RSS or
Atom feed is offered.

I personally use [Thunderbird][1] as both my email and news reader. Do you
have other suggestions, [let me know][2] and I can list them here.


Email list
----------

I also set up a [mailing list][3] if you prefer email.


Other ways
----------

I'm active on [Twitter][4] and will also post any blog updates there.


Thank you!

Thanks for being interested. If you have any feedback I would love to hear it!
