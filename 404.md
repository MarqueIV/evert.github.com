404!
====

The most well known HTTP error code, and you hit it..


If you followed a broken link, I would LOVE to hear
about it. It may mean I made a mistake somewhere, and I rather have that fixed.

Easiest is to contact me on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@evert) or [Email!](mailto:blog@evertpot.com).

You can also head back to the <a href="/">index</a>.
