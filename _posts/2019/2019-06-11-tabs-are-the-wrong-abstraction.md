Back when Internet Explorer was dominant, and every developer I knew installed
Firefox on every family member and their dogs desktop, I remember a big selling
point for convincing people to use Firefox was 'Tabs'.

Firefox may not have been the first browser to introduce tabs, but in my
experience it was the number one selling point to get people to switch.
Especially those that otherwise didn't care about Internet Explorer being
dominant and stagnating the web.

Since then, pretty much every desktop browser has adopted the same basic UI
only mild variations.

One thing that kind of interests me is that every now and then I spot someone
with a ridiculous number of tabs open. On Firefox this is still somewhat
managable, because tabs don't shrink below a certain size, but show arrows on
each side to scroll through them, along with a menu.

On Chrome though, having a lot of tabs open makes it become completely
unusable.

The surprising thing to me is that I see this a lot on family members' and
friends' screens.

When I would see this at first, I admit I may have made a little fun of people.
Maybe commenting on their poor organizational skills, but I soon realized this
pattern was common enough that it's hard to blame the user, and I've started to
feel that for many (if not most) browser users, the tab is just a bad UI.

When interviewing people with a ton of tabs on their screen and asking them
why, the most common responses can be somewhat categorized as:

* I need to get back to that tab later.
* I just keep opening new tabs and forget about the old ones.

When asking the first group for more information, I realized that a lot of
people use tabs as a sort of bookmark. Something to get back to later. One
person I talked to was afraid for restarting their computer, because of the
risk of not being able to get back to their open tabs.

I tend to use tabs for 'currently active work' and tend to keep them somewhat
organized, and I'm sure there are plenty of people like myself. But for all
the people that accumulate hundreds of tabs, I feels like the time is right for
a better paradigm that combines bookmarks, tabs and history.

Maybe organizing sessions in interactive timelines and groups things together
based on behavior would be better suited. I think anything that requires active
management and organizing would probably fail. I don't think I would remove the
tab altogether, but just show me the last few things, treat them as emphemeral
and provide an option to explore my current and previous session(s).

I'm sure experiments are out there, but so far it doesn't seem like major
browser vendors have had the guts to release something new. This is a bit
surprising to me because despite the fact that competition is fierce and
users tend to have strong opinions, everyone seems to be doing very similar
things and converge on Chrome.

Perhaps part of the issue is that everyone just wants to cater to the largest
possible audience, making everyone risk averse.

Anyway, this is all speculation with no data from a non-expert. Curious what
your thoughts are, or if you know of any experiments that solve this problem.
