In the early 90's, being a dutch kid obsessed with computers there weren't a
ton of ways to get access to new software or learn more about computers.

The two main ways were exchanging 3.5" diskettes with friends, or go to the
library. One book I remember more than others was "Windows for Kinderen"
("Windows for Kids") by Addo Stuur.

I must have been around 10 years old and was obsessed by this book. It covered
Windows 3.0, and when you got the book from the library, it came with a diskette
filled to the brim with shareware. Mostly games and
useless toys, but it still baffles me thinking they had to cram it all on
a 1.44 megabyte disk.

One that I remembered particularly well was 'Neko', an application that
renders a cat in a window that follows your mouse. This must have been a
popular thing to make at the time, because the diskette somehow had space
for 3(!) different ports of this same application.

I don't know what reminded me of Neko last week, but I started doing some
more research, and found out that the first version was written all the
way back in the 1980's by Naoshi Watanabe for the [NEC PC 9801][1].

After that, it was ported to the Macintosh in 1981 by Kenji Gotoh, and this
art style seems to be the basis of almost every future port:

In 1991, IBM included it in OS/2! Apparently they paid 300,000 YEN, which
is about $3000 CAD in todays money. At this point it also became public
domain.

Since then there's been countless ports for every platform. If you're running
linux you might be able to install one by just running:

```sh
apt install oneko
```

I also decided to make a version. Neko is now close to 40, so my version is
no longer interested in following the mouse, and prefers to just sleep all day 
unless you wake it.

If you want to know more, the Eliot Akira wrote [a great article with way
more information about Neko and all its ports][2],
this is also where I took the screenshots from this page.

You can also check out the [source][3] of my port. It uses the assets of
[oneko][4], which are public domain. It was a fun exercise to create a
little state machine.

<script src="/assets/posts/neko/jneko.js"></script>
<script>

function loadNeko() {

  new Neko(document.getElementById('neko1'));
  new Neko(document.getElementById('neko2'));

}

window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => loadNeko());
