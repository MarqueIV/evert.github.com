Daylight savings time is hated by many, and twice per year a discussion
reignites to get rid of it. Lot of folks feel this is a great idea. This year
[this decision][1] seems especially close in the US. If this law passes, it
will probably also change where I live ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

No doubt there's lots of benefits and advantages to this, I don't want to
dispute that. This is also not an endorsement against that change, but I do
however want to bring light to at least one disadvantage:

The timezone change was for a lot of developers a twice-per-year reminder
that we need to use timezone databases and libraries.

This is useful, because every year many countries change their timezone
rules. This means that if you schedule something in the future, say.. 2pm 6
months from, you don't know yet with absolute certainty what UTC timestamp
this will be. This is especially important when scheduling between people
in multiple timezones.

The right way to handle this is to store the intended local time + a location
such as `America/Toronto`. `EST` is not enough, because it's `EDT` half the
year, and obviously neither is `+0500`.

Timezones are relatively stable in North America, but the US also made a
change [in 2007][2], and it sounds like we may have another one in the future!

So this bi-annual time change was a great reminder to many developers that
timezones are a thing, and you can't just naively assume a UTC time + an
offset is enough. Even more so for teams that are spread cross-continent
because the DST change doesn't fall on the same day. Currently I'm in the
3 weeks per year the time difference between me and my parents is 5 
instead of 6 hours.

A lot of programming is (seems?) anglo-centric. A similar situation is that
before Emoji became wide-spread it was way more common to see a lot more
issues around encoding non-ascii characters.

So if DST goes away in North America, I predict we'll see a lot more bugs
related to timezones, affecting countries that have not yet abolished
DST and places whenever they change *their* rules.

So when you hear developers excited about the US abolishing DST because it
will make their (work) life simpler, remind them this is only true if you
never intend your software to be used outside of north america, or if the
entire rest of the world makes the same change and also freezes all
timezone rules forever!
