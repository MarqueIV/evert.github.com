I've been a Twitter user and fan since 2007, Now Twitter's future is
looking a bit grim, I started looking around if there's another place to go.

Twitter can't really be replaced with anything else, because everyone's
Twitter experience is unique to them and their community. For me, it's
the main way I stay in touch with my Open Source / HTTP / API / Hypermedia
bubble and some friends. Losing that would suck! Unfortunately, there's no way
that group would all flock to another platform.

But for the ones that do try something else, the talk of the town seems
to be [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).

Mastadon is interesting, because on the surface it might just seem like a
Twitter clone, but it's based on a federated protocol called 'ActivityPub'.
What this means in practice, is that there's no central server. There's
many [instances](https://joinmastodon.org/servers). Each of these instances
is managed by different people, and many of them focus on specific interests.

With email, it doesn't matter which provider you go with, you can send and
receive messages to everyone else. This is the same with Mastadon. You're not
siloed into a single instance, and you can follow people from any other
instance. Unlike email, it appears that with
Mastadon you can actually migrate to different instances if you don't like
your current one.

This has some interesting side effects too. I joined the
[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) instance, which is a community I already
loved. And even though I'm not siloed in, I get access to a local feed of
like-minded people from that community. Everything feels new and more
intimate.

Also instead of one central authority that you have to trust to make the right
moderation decisions, you can join one of many that aligns with your values,
and you can block entire instances that don't.

So should you join? If you use Twitter to stay on top of news and follow high
profile people then probably not. If you're like me, you might be able to
find a community that fits your interest.

Will I stick to this? Who knows... but Twitter, like everything before it
will fall out of favor one day and I'm enjoying the ad-free, open source,
developer-friendly experience. Reminds me of early Twitter.

## Links

* If you're just getting started, check out <https://joinmastadon.org/> and
  find a server.
* [Follow me!](https://indieweb.social/web/@evert)
* To find your Twitter friends on Mastadon try [Twitodon](https://twitodon.com/) and [Fedifinder](https://fedifinder.glitch.me/).
* To automatically cross-post everything from Twitter to Mastodon and vice versa, use [Moa](https://moa.party/).

Lastly, one of the interesting results of Mastodon building on open protocols,
is that it allows alternative implementations.

The [Microblog.pub](https://microblog.pub/) project lets you self-host a
single-user instance. Instead of joining some large instance, you deploy
an instance on your own domain that's just for you. Can't get more control
than that, and this might be something I'll consider in the future.

I don't see why this blog couldn't one also be a 'microblog' and part of the
fediverse.
