Because I want to get into the habit of blogging on a regular basis, I thought
it would be a fun idea to write a series of articles on one of my favourite
topics: HTTP and Webservices.

To start, I began writing an article for every HTTP status code. I only
realized after I drafted the first few, that the [IANA][1] page actually lists
68 official ones. Definitely a bit more than I thought, but I started and I'm
going to see if I can finish it.

I'm going to release the first few this week, and then switch to a weekly
schedule. Hopefully I can keep this going for a year!

Today I published the first one: [100 Continue][2].
