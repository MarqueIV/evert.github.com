Last year I quit my job at Yelp, and wanted to be a more active blogger again.
I thought it would be a neat idea to write 1 post per week, one for each HTTP
status.

This was quite an undertaking, and I ended up having to write 67 blog posts,
one each week.

Some stats:

* **67** HTTP statuses.
* **70** blog posts written.
* **18091** words written.
* Articles written in **9** cities, **5** countries.
* **53,511** page views.

Was it worth it? I don't really know. I had higher hopes in terms of
popularity. Most of the traffic comes from search results and hotlinks, but
I don't think I achieved what I had really hoped: build a bit more of a
consistent audience.

I think part of the problem with building audiences is that people don't
really subsribe to RSS feeds anymore. I offered a twitter feed and a mailing
list as well, but who wants to receive more emails? It seems that most people
consume their technical content from aggregrators like Hackenernews and silos
like Medium.

It feels like a big loss that RSS feeds have gone out of fashion, not just for
me but also the industry. I still miss the blogging revolution of the
mid-2000's. Or maybe HTTP statuses are just wayy too boring, and I mistook my
own interest with everyone else's.

Still, I'm glad that I saw it all the way through, and it's nice to see that
people seem to find these pages on google, or use them as a reference. There's
definitely a few in there that have some nuance, so I hope I positively
contributed to the API ecosystem.

For the few that followed this series, thank you!
