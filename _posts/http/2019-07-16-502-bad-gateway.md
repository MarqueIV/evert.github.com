HTTP is a protocol that is implemented by servers and clients, but there is
a third category: proxies.

When a system is acting as a proxy for a different server, and that server is
misbehaving or doing something unexpected, the proxy can return
[`502 Bad Gateway`][1] to tell a client that the proxy is working fine, but
there was something wrong with the 'origin' server instead.

A specific example of this could be a CDN in front on a web server, and the
web-server is misconfigured and responding with incorrect HTTP responses.

This status should not be used if the origin server just returned a valid
HTTP error itself, because these should generally just be forwarded by the
proxy (mostly) unaltered.

Example
-------

```http
HTTP/1.1 502 Bad Gateway
Content-Type text/plain

We made a HTTP request to an origin server, but we got a Gopher response back.
```
