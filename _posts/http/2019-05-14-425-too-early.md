When a HTTP client makes a connection to a HTTPS server, it uses TLS
to create a secure connection. TLS can have a bit of a complicated
'handshake' to establish the connection. Because there's a bunch of back and
forward, this can take a long time, especially when there's a lot of latency
between server and client.

There are ways for clients to optimize this setup by sending a bunch of data
very early in the process, before the full TLS connection is completely setup.

In some cases this can cause security problems. In those cases a the server
can tell the client to retry a specific HTTP request after the TLS connection
has been fully set up

In these situations, it will return the [`425 Too Early`][1] status code.

Normally, you would never have to deal with this status code as a developer,
unless you are creating HTTP(s) servers from scratch.
