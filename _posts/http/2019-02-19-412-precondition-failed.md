In HTTP it's possible to do conditional requests. These are requests that only
execute if the right conditions are met.

For `GET` requests, this might be done to only retrieve the resource if it has
changed. For those cases [`304 Not Modified`][2] is returned.

For other cases, `412 Precondition Failed` is returned.

Examples
--------

This client only wants the `PUT` request to succeed, if it didn't already
exist:

```http
PUT /foo/new-article.md HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/markdown
If-None-Match: *
```

This request is an update, and it should only succeed if the article hasn't
changed since last time.

```http
PUT /foo/old-article.md HTTP/1.1
If-Match: "1345-12315"
Content-Type: text/markdown
```

If the condition didn't pass, it returns:

```http
HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed
Content-Type: text/plain

The article you're tring to update has changed since you last seen it.
```

One great advantage of this is that prevents lost updates, due to multiple
people writing to the same resource. This is also known as the 'lost update'
problem.

Using the `Prefer` header, it's possible for a client to get the current
state of the resource, in case the local copy was outdated. This saves a `GET`
request.

```http
PUT /foo/old-article.md HTTP/1.1
If-Match: "1345-12315"
Content-Type: text/markdown
Prefer: return=representation

### Article version 2.1
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed
Content-Type: text/markdown
Etag: "4444-12345"
Vary: Prefer

### Article version 3.0
```

This is useful, but it should probably have been designed with a HTTP/2 Push
message instead. Nevertheless, there's no harm in adopting this for legacy
HTTP/1.1 systems.
