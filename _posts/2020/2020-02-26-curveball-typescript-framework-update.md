Since mid-2018 we've been working on a new micro-framework, written in
typescript. The framework competes with [Express][1], and takes heavy
inspiration from [Koa][2]. It's called [Curveball][8].

If you only ever worked with Express, I feel that for most people this
project will feel like a drastic step up. Express was really written in an
earlier time of Node.js, before Promises and async/await were commonplace,
so first and foremost the biggest change is the use of async/await middlewares
throughout.

If you came from Koa, that will already be familiar. Compared to Koa, these
are the major differences:

* Curveball is written in Typescript
* It has strong built-in support HTTP/2 push.
* Native support for running servers on AWS Lambda, without the use of
  [strange hacks][3].
* Curveball's request/response objects are decoupled from the Node.js `http`
  library.

At [Bad Gateway][11] we've been using this in a variety of (mostly API)
projects for the past few years, and it's been working really well for us.
We're also finding that it tends to be a pretty 'sticky' product. People exposed
to it tend to want to use it for their next project too.

Curious? Here are a bunch of examples of common tasks:

Examples
--------

### Hello world

```typescript
import { Application } from '@curveball/core';

const app = new Application();
app.use( async ctx => {
  ctx.response.type = 'text/plain';
  ctx.body = 'hello world';
});

app.listen(80);
```

Everything is a middleware, and middlewares may or may not be `async`.

### Hello world on AWS Lambda

```typescript
import { Application } from '@curveball/core';
import { handler } from '@curveball/aws-lambda';

const app = new Application();
app.use( ctx => {
  ctx.response.type = 'text/plain';
  ctx.response.body = 'hello world';
});

exports.handler = handler(app);
```

### HTTP/2 Push

```typescript
const app = new Application();
app.use( ctx => {
  ctx.response.type = 'text/plain';
  ctx.body = 'hello world';

  ctx.push( pushCtx => {

    pushCtx.path = '/sub-item';
    pushCtx.response.type = 'text/html';
    pushCtx.response.body = '<h1>Automatically pushed!</h1>';

  });


});
```

### Resource-based controllers

Controllers are optional and opinionated. A single controller should only ever
manage one type of resource, or one route.


```typescript
import { Application, Context } from '@curveball/core';
import { Controller } from '@curveball/controller';

const app = new Application();

class MyController extends Controller {

  get(ctx: Context) {

    // This is automatically triggered for GET requests

  }

  put(ctx: Context) {

    // This is automatically triggered for PUT requests

  }

}

app.use(new MyController());
```

### Routing

The recommended pattern is to use exactly one controller per route.

```typescript
import { Application } from '@curveball/core';
import router from '@curveball/router';

const app = new Application();

app.use(router('/articles', new MyCollectionController());
app.use(router('/articles/:id', new MyItemController());
```

### Content-negotation in controllers

```typescript
import { Context } from '@curveball/core';
import { Controller, method, accept } from '@curveball/controller';

class MyController extends Controller {

  @accept('html')
  @method('GET')
  async getHTML(ctx: Context) {

    // This is automatically triggered for GET requests with
    // Accept: text/html

  }

  @accept('json')
  @method('GET')
  async getJSON(ctx: Context) {

    // This is automatically triggered for GET requests with
    // Accept: application/json

  }

}
```

### Emitting errors

To emit a HTTP error, it's possible to set `ctx.status`, but easier to just
throw a related exception.


```typescript
function myMiddleware(ctx: Context, next: Middleware) {

  if (ctx.method !== 'GET') {
    throw new MethodNotAllowed('Only GET is allowed here');
  }
  await next();

}
```

The project also ships with a [middleware][5] to automatically generate
[RFC7807][4] `application/problem+json` responses.

### Transforming HTTP responses in middlewares

With express middlewares it's easy to do something *before* a request was
handled, but if you ever want to transform a response in a middleware, this
can only be achieved through a complicated hack.

This is due to the fact that responses are immediately written to the TCP
sockets, and once written to the socket it's effecftively gone.

So to do things like gzipping responses, Express middleware authors needs to
mock the response stream and intercept any bytes sent to it. This can be
clearly seen in the express-compression source:
<https://github.com/expressjs/compression/blob/master/index.js>.

Curveball does not do this. Response bodies are buffered and available by
middlewares.

For example, the following middleware looks for a HTTP Accept header of
`text/html` and automatically transforms JSON to a simple HTML output:

```typescript
app.use( async (ctx, next) => {

  // Let the entire middleware stack run
  await next();
 
  // HTML encode JSON responses if the client was a browser.
  if (ctx.accepts('text/html') && ctx.response.type ==== 'application/json') {
    ctx.response.type = 'text/html';
    ctx.response.body = '<h1>JSON source</h1><pre>' + JSON.stringify(ctx.response.body) + '</pre>';
  }

});
```

To achieve the same thing in express would be quite complicated.

You might wonder if this is bad for performance for large files. You would be
completely right, and this is not solved yet.

However, instead of writing directly to the output stream the intent for this
is to allow users to set a callback on the `body` property, so writing the
body will not be buffered, just deferred. The complexity of implementing these
middlewares will not change.

### HTML API browser

Curveball also ships with an [API browser][6] that automatically transforms
JSON in to traversable HTML, and automatically parses HAL links and HTTP Link
headers.

Every navigation element is completely generated based on links found in the
response.

To use it:

```typescript
import { halBrowser } from 'hal-browser';
import { Application } from '@curveball/core';

const app = new Application();
app.use(halBrowser());
```

Once set up, your API will start rendering HTML when accessed by a browser.

### Sending informational responses

```typescript
ctx.response.sendInformational(103, {
  link: '</foo>; rel="preload"'
})
```

### Parsing Prefer headers

```typescript
const foo = ctx.request.prefer('return');
// Could be 'representation', 'minimal' or false
console.log(foo);
```

Installation and links
----------------------

Installation:

```
npm i @curveball/core
```

Documentation can be found on [Github][10]. A list of middlewares can be seen
in the [organization page][8].


Stable release
--------------

We're currently on the 11th beta, and closing in on a stable release. Changes
will at this point be minor.

If you have thoughts or feedback on this project, it would be really helpful
to hear. Don't hesitate to leave comments, questions or suggestions as a
[Github Issue][7].

A big thing that's still to be done is the completion of the [website][9]. We
got a great design, it just needs to be pushed over the finish line.

One more thing?
---------------

Apologies for the clich√© header. We're also working on an Authentcation server,
written in curveball. It handles the following for you:

* Login
* Registration
* Lost password
* OAuth2:
  * `client_credentials`, `password`, `authorization_code` grant types.
  * revoke, introspect support
* TOTP (Google authenticator style)
* User management, privilege management.

The project needs some love in the user experience department, but if you're
stick of creating another authentication system and don't want to break the
bank, [a12n-server][12] might be for you.

The ultimate goal here is to create a great headless authentication server,
and compete with OAuth0 and Okta, but we can use some more people power here!
