We just released [Ketting 6][1]. This is the accumulation of about a year
of learnings on how to better integrate REST APIs with frontend frameworks,
in particular React.

It's packed with new features such as local state management, new caching
strategies, (client-side) middleware support and change events. It's also
the first release that has some larger BC breaks to make this all work.

What's Ketting?
---------------

In short: Ketting is a generic REST client for Javascript. You can use it
for pushing JSON objects via HTTP, but the richer your API is in terms of
best practices and standard formats, the more it can automatically do for
you.

It has support for Hypermedia formats such as HAL, Siren, Collection+JSON,
JSON:API and can even understand and follow links from HTML.

More information can be found on [Github][1].


React support in Ketting 6
--------------------------

Ketting now has a separate [react-ketting][2] package that provides React
bindings to Ketting. These bindings should look very familiar if you've
used [Apollo Client][3] in the past.

Lets dive into an example:

Lets assume you have a REST api that has an 'article' endpoint. This returns
something like:

```json
{
  "title": "Hello world",
  "body": "...
}
```

This article is retrieved with `GET`, and updated with `PUT`, this is how
you would display it:

```javascript
import { useResource } from 'react-ketting';


export function Article() {

  const { loading, error, data } = useResource('https://api.example/article/5');

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading..</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div class="error">{error.message}</div>;
  }

  return <article>
    <h1>{data.title}</h1>
    <p>{data.body}</p>
  </article>;

}
```

But what about mutations? Unlike GraphQL, mutations in REST APIs often have
the same format for `GET` and `PUT`, so sending an updated resource to a
server often just means mutating your 'data' and sending it back.

The following example would allow a user to edit an article and send it back:

```javascript
import { useResource } from 'react-ketting';


export function Article() {

  const { loading, error, data, setData, submit } = 
    useResource('https://api.example/article/5');

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading..</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div class="error">{error.message}</div>;
  }

  const changeTitle = (title) => {
    data.title = title;
    setData(data);
  };
  const changeBody = (body) => {
    data.body = body;
    setData(data);
  };

  return <form onsubmit={() => submit}>
    <input type="text" value={data.title} onChange={ev => changeTitle(ev.target.value)  />
    <textarea onChange={ev => changeBody(ev.target.value)}>{data.body}</textarea>
    <button type="submit">Save!</button>
  </form>;

}
```

Whenever `setData` is called, the internal Ketting cache is updated with the new
resource state. This is globally stored, based on the uri of the resource.

This means that if multiple components use `useResource` on that same uri,
every component will see that update and triggere a re-render.

This is similar to Apollo's local state, except it's still bound to a single
resource uri and can eventually be saved.

When `submit()` is called, the `data` is re-serialized and sent in a `PUT`
request.


Future plans
------------

The next two things we are working on are:

* Deeper support for forms and actions from HAL Forms, Siren and HTML.
* Websocket support for live server-initiated state pushes.
