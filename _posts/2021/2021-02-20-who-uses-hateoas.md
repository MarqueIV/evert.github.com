* [Amazon AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/) uses HAL
  for their API Gateway service.
* [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) uses a custom format,
  but links are used across the board to find related resources.
* [The Guardian](https://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-guardian-approaching-hypermedia-based-api-infrastructure/2015/04/27)
  appears to be using [Argo](https://github.com/argo-rest/spec) for some of
  their internal APIs.
