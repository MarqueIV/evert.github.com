I'm a few days late, but as of May 25, 2021 I've had this blog for 15 years!
I guess it also makes this my longest running project.

The blog went through quite a few iterations and platforms, but the current
Github Pages iteration is about 8 years old already.

This is how it looked between 2006 and 2010:

This was definitely the most elaborate design, but eventually I got sick of a
hand-written PHP and switched to a more plain [Habari][1]-based blog.

I've had plans for years to move away from Github pages again, and do a custom
build. Github pages is so easy to use, but the lack of a server-side language
stifles my creativity a bit. I want to add a regular-old comment system again
and add websockets for bits of creativity.

## Some stats

<a href="/assets/posts/blog-15-years/ga.png"><img src="/assets/posts/blog-15-years/ga.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Habari Blog from ga" /></a>

* Since I started measuring in 2010, Google Analytics has reported
  **2 million** pageviews!
* I've published **426** posts. The number of posts is trending downwards
  year-over-year. I find it harder to just write about a small interesting
  thing I came across, and posts tend to be more long-form now.
* I wrote articles in **15** countries, in **5** continents!
* I got **101** email [subscribers][6]!

The most popular post ever is about [following redirects in PHP][2], which
probably has to do more with good search keywords than anything. **144,565**
pageviews.

I also wrote 68 post for [every HTTP status code][3]. Combined, they got
**202,656** page views as of today.

My proudest post is about [HTTP/2, Server Push and compound documents][4],
because I added a bunch of interactivity that I think a lot of people loved.
I'd like to do more like this, but it was extremely time consuming. Must have
been at least 100 hours.

## Thanks!

Thanks everyone for reading and supporting! It's all the great responses that
give me the energy and motivation to keep going =)
