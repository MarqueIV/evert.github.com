I grew up in the Netherlands, but I moved to Canada for my first programmer
job at age 20. I stayed for a few years, moved back and started a job there,
and eventually moved _back_ to Canada again and pretty much settled here.

I got strong roots and professional experience in both places, but there was
one thing that surprised me most in the Netherlands that I haven't really seen
in North America.

Apparently Netherlands has a very high rate of part time careers (I read
statistics suggesting they are the highest in the world by large margin, but
I didn't trust the sources enough to share, suffice to say they are probably
high). My personal experience matches this too. I know a number of people that
choose to work less, and I think there are more opportunities for part-time
career jobs. I don't see them much in North America.

My first-hand experience is when I was interviewing a few years into my
career at a company named Ibuildings in Utrecht, Netherlands. After the
interview I was told I pretty much had the job, and then the interviewer
asked me if I wanted to work 4 or 5 days per week.

I only had Canadian work experience, so I was pretty shocked being asked
this. Picking 4 days seemed like a no-brainer to me. 
I would get paid for 32 hours per week, instead of 40 and got to pick a
day of the week I wanted off (I picked Friday). At this company
I believe most people took the 4-day option. So yes, I got paid 20% less,
but with the tax bracket I was in this was closer to 10%.

For me it was great. 5 days actually feels like a lot, and 2 days in a
weekend never feels quite enough. A sentiment so common it's boring talk
about it. I actually used the extra time to work on open source.

I'm leaning pretty socialist, but even with a capitalist hat on, I'm
surprised this doesn't happen more. Why not give employees the option to
do this? Not everyone will take the option, but for those that do here's some
advantages:

Advantages of offering 80% jobs
-------------------------------

* For the salary cost of 4 employees at 40 hours, you get 5 employees at 32
  hours.
* Those 5 employees are more rested, and may be generally happier.
* You get the combined experience of 5 people instead of 4.
* Also I don't believe for the 80% workers, you only get 80% output. Most
  people just aren't productive all the time.
* Advertising this as a benefit in your company may also be attractive to
  candidates for hiring.

There are also some drawbacks. Every employee will have some overhead such as
a laptop, benefits and general admin. Probably a larger expense is the cost
to recruit, although it seems that the number of jobs has shrunk significantly
this year, so the supply is likely the highest its been in many years.

But my intuition tells me that this overhead is probably well worth the
benefit of a smarter, larger, happier workforce.

So why aren't we doing this? Is it just cultural? Are there risks I'm unaware
of? There's some old fashioned CEO's out there of course, but I would have
expected there to be more experimentation.
