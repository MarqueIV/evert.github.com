I grew up in the Netherlands, but I moved to Canada for my first programmer
job at age 20. I stayed for a few years, moved back and started a job there,
and eventually moved _back_ to Canada again and pretty much settled here.

I got strong roots and professional experience in both places, but there was
one thing that surprised me most in the Netherlands that I haven't really seen
in North America.

Apparently Netherlands has a very high rate of part time careers (I read
statistics suggesting they are the highest in the world by large margin, but
I didn't trust the sources enough to share, suffice to say they are probably
high). My personal experience matches this too. I know a number of people that
choose to work less, and I think there are more opportinities for part-time
career jobs. I don't see them much in North America.

My own first-hand experience is when I applied for my first real Dutch job,
a few years into my career at a company then named Ibuildings. After the
interview I was told I pretty much had the job, and I the interviewer
asked me if I wanted to work 4 or 5 days per week.

I only had Canadian work experience, so I was pretty shocked. Picking 4 days
seemed like a no-brainer to me. I would get paid for 32 hours per week,
instead of 40 and got to pick a day of the week I wanted off. At this company
I believe most people took this option. So yes, I got paid 20% less, but with
the tax bracket I was in this was closer to 10%.

I'm leaning pretty socialist, but with my strict capitalist hat on, I'm
surprised this doesn't happen more. Why not give employees the option to
do this? Not everyone will take the option, but for those that do here's some
advantages:

* For the salary cost of 4 employees at 40 hours, you get 5 employees at 32
  hours, thus you are creating more jobs.
* Those 5 employees are more rested, and may be generally happier.
* You get the combined experience of 5 people instead of 4.
* Also I don't believe for the 80% workers, you only get 80% output. Most
  people just aren't productive all the time.
* Advertising this as an option may also be attractive to candidates for
  hiring.

There are also some drawbacks. Every employee will have fixed cost such as
a laptop, benefits, administration. Probably a larger cost is also the cost
to recruit, although it seems that the number of jobs has shrunk significantly
this year, so the supply is likely the highest its been in many years.

But my intuition tells me that this overhead is probably well worth the
benefit of a smarter, larger, happier workforce.

So why aren't we doing this? Is it just cultural? Are there risks I'm unaware
of?
