In 2019 I started Bad Gateway as a software development agency. Last year we
grew all the way to 7 people. It was crazy challenging, especially with Covid
in the mix; but ultimately could not get the company into a good financial
state to be able to carry on.

Big thanks to my co-workers and partners [Ju][1], [Becky][2], [Phil][3],
[Michael][4], [Siep][5], [Richard][6] and [Syed][7].
I'm incredibly grateful you came on this journey with me. We shared some
tears, exchanged some words but mostly had lots of laughs. Despite the
challenges I feel my relationship with you has only strengthened and I wish
you well in the next steps of your career.

Also thank you to our customers and especially [Underknown][8] who've stuck
with us since the start.

Despite this outcome, I have a hard time seeing the last few years as a
failure. It's been hella fun, and I feel we stuck to our values even in times
of crisis. Off to the next adventure.
