Today I added a nifty tagcloud below my archives..

Nothing special, and I probably will have to tweak it when more tags are
added, but hey.. it's something ;)

I also added a new url scheme for tags, for example:

<a href="/tag/general" class="dead-link">/tag/general</a> will give you all the posts tagged as 'general'
