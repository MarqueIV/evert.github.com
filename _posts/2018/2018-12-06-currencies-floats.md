A very common and oft-repeated programmer's wisdom is "Don't use floats for
currency". This always made a lot of sense to me. The idea is that floats are
imprecise, due to the way they are stored.

Effectively floats are stored not by just their digits, but by a [formula][2].
This formula can't accurately represent every fraction. The most popular way
to demonstrate this is by firing up your Javascript developer console and run:

```
> 0.3 - 0.2
0.09999999999999998
```

The answer you'll get is not `0.1`, it's `0.09999999999999998`. According to
many, this is easy proof why floats are bad for money.

It's also not really something you want to put on an invoice. Some suggestions
to avoid floats include:

* Generally when dealing with money, use specialized data stores. MySQL for
  example has the [`DECIMAL`][3] field type.
* When serializing currency values, in for example JSON, pass them around as
  a string, not a number.

Another very common advice is, when doing math based on currency values just
forget about the floating point and count cents instead of Euros, Yen or
[Dollarydoos][4].

So instead of `$ 5.00`, you would simply multiply by 100 and use `500`, which
fits in an integer.

This is a pretty good way to deal with simple invoicing, where for the most
part you're just adding numbers.

Fractions
---------

With these wisdoms in hand I stepped into a problem that is a bit more complex.
I needed to do calculations with fractions for financial analysis.

I'll keep my example simple, but lets say that I needed to find out what 31%
of $498.09 is.

The result of this can't be expressed as a decimal number. On your JS console
it might look something like this:

    154.40789999999998

This is not just due to the fact that this is a floating point number, the
other is simply that this number can't be expressed without a fraction at all.
The 9's repeat infinitely.

But this led me to think, why do I really care about this really precise
number. The part I'm really interested in is `$154.41`, so I can just round
the result and get a string:

    > (input * 0.31).toFixed(2);
    '154.41'

For my purposes, this was the *right* answer. Money isn't expressed as
fractions (beyond cents), and it's rounded in a lot of situations.

This led me to my next realization. The `0.3 - 0.2` example was really a
strawman. I can just round it to get the number I really wanted:

    > (0.3 - 0.2).toFixed(2);
    '0.10'

This was the correct answer all along. The fact that we needed to first get
`0.09999999999999998` as an intermediate answer is kind of irrelevant, because
the difference is so little, and we would have to round anyway before display.

A better example
----------------

This last exercise just made me realize a few things:

* `0.3 - 0.2` is not a good example of why using floating points are bad.
  $0.00000000000000002 is not a significant difference.
* Unless you are comfortable writing your financial reports with formulas
  instead of numbers, rounding is unavoidable.
* Everybody rounds, regardless of the number system. If you use floating point
  math or fixed point math, you actually suffer from the exact same problem.

So I wanted to find out if there are examples where using floating-point math
does become an issue. Where are its limits?

One way I thought of thinking about this, is by trying to come up with a
formula where this $0.00000000000000002 difference compound into a dollar.
Just multiplying it by $10,000,000,000,000,000 doesn't seem reasonable,
because that number is (currently) too high to show up in a financial
calculation.

I had trouble finding good examples to demonstrate this issue, and I'm not
really smart enough to come up with an idea of my own. But even if I knew of
a great example one thought kept lingering: The inaccuracy
problem with floats also exists in other number systems that don't use
floats, such as base10 (fixed point) math. With fixed point math you
basically pick a precision (for example, 15 digits) and rounding errors beyond
that precision can also show up in certain complex calculations.

**Edit**

I got an _excellent_ example when asking around from
[@scurker](http://scurker.com/), the author of the [currency.js][13] project.

His example was this:

```javascript
(17.954 + .001).toFixed(2); // => "17.96"
```

Even though this calculation should result in `17.955`, which _should_ round to
`17.95`, because `.001` cannot be exactly represented by floating point numbers,
the total ends up being `17.955000000000002`, which rounds up.

So this is a super clear example of a very small difference that results in a
significant change. I couldn't think of this myself, but this makes it super
clear to me why fixed-point math makes sense.


A few deductions
----------------

I don't know if this is correct, but it feels correct:

1. Floating point math and base10 (fixed point) math have similar problems
   with inaccuracies and rounding.
2. These problems show up for different calculations. The result of some
   calculations cannot be precisely expressed with floating point math, and
   the result of other calculations cannot be precisely expressed with
   fixed-point math.
3. Insignificant differences can show up as significant ones when rounding.


~~What I don't know is around what scales floating point math can yield
significant inaccurate results. It seems simpler to predict this with
fixed-point math.~~

~~I think this predictability makes people feel safer doing financial
calculations.~~

Using fixed point math in Javascript
------------------------------------

At the start of this article I mentioned the solution to just multiply
currencies by 100 and count cents. Realistically this is pretty useless
for anything moderately complex, because you limit your precision to 2
decimals.

If you feel that you have a use-case where multiplying by 100 is enough
precision, you are probably better off using floating points and simple
rounding.

To make fixed-point math work for more complex calculations, you'll need
more significant digits, and thus multiply by larger numbers than 100.
When researching this I [read a great article about math in COBOL][4],
which mentions that IBM's fixed point decimal type can take a maximum of 18
digits.

If we take 99 billion dollar as the maximum we want to be able to represent,
this means that of those 18 digits, we need 11 digits before and 7 digits
after the period.

This means that every dollar value has to be multiplied by 10<sup>7</sup>
(10,000,000,000).

It also means that the highest number we ever need is 10<sup>18</sup>.

This number is unfortunately is higher than Javascript's
[`MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`][7], which is 2<sup>53</sup> - 1.

When working with integers in Javascript above this `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`,
Javascript will automatically convert to floating point numbers, which is what
we were trying to avoid.

How would you solve this?

Right now the established way is to use a library that handles this for you.
Some examples are:

* [decimal.js][8].
* [bignumber.js][9].

These types of libraries handle these limitations by (for example) saving
every digit of a large number separately in an array, and do a more 'manual'
work with arithmetic operations. For example, 100 might be stored as [1, 0, 0].

What's nice about these libraries is that they convert to and from strings
for your view layer and they remember where the (fixed) point in your number
is, so you don't have to divide by 10<sup>7</sup> before displaying them.

These libraries might be a bit slow though. Other programming languages might
have built-in features or native modules for this. PHP for example has a
[GMP][10] module. Java has [`java.math.BigDecimal`][11]. Python is the clear
winner here and just has transparent native support for arbitrary-size integers.


Ecmascript's bigint
-------------------

If you are running a new version of Firefox, Chrome or Node.js, you might
already have support for a new Javascript type: [bigint][12].

"bigint" is what it says on the tin, a type for big integers. These new numbers
don't automatically change to floats (or regular numbers) unless explicitly
asked to and don't have a maximum size, other than the limits of your
computer.

Fire up your console and try it out:

    > 2n ** 4018n

Another interesting thing about these numbers is that they always round:

    > 5n / 2n
    2n

Using the bigint type is going to be a much faster than the npm libraries.
The only drawback is that the bigint doesn't have a decimal point, so I'm
forced to multiply every number by the precision I want. This will make my
code potentially harder to read.

~~But with all these nice new features, I still haven't found a satisfying
answer to my original question: under what conditions do floating point
numbers break down for financial calculations?~~

Another floating point bug was when I needed to pass integer ids to the user interface
and pass them back. These numbers were larger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER:

```
>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
9007199254740991
```

[@drkbugs](https://github.com/drkblog) says:

In my experience with floating point errors you get a lot of impact without going under two decimal points when you add filtering to the combo.

```
if (2.3 - 1.3 - 1 == 0) {
  console.log("Zero");
}
```

And this is an operation you may expect when dealing with money.
