Since 2016 I've been working on a javascript library to make it easier to work
with [HAL][1] REST services. Yesterday I realized I implemented all the
features I wanted for a 1.0 release, and also that I never talked about it on
this blog.

So this evening I released 1.0, and also share some information about it here.
It's been almost a year since I blogged! Really gotta get back on this horse.

A bit of background
-------------------

Nearly 2 years ago we implemented a new API at a company I worked at. We chose
to go the REST/hypermedia/HATEOAS route and use [HAL][1] as the primary
format.

I had a drive to try and see what a good client for this would look like, so
I decided to write my own in my free time.

This client is written in Javacript, works in node.js and in browsers. We use
it as a real client, but also doing black-box testing of API's.

A summarized list of features
-----------------------------

* It parses HAL `_links` and provides a convenient API for following links.
* Uses the [Fetch API][2] for HTTP requests and is heavily promise-based.
* Automatically parsed items in `_embedded` and stores them in a cache. The
  nice thing about this is that if a server chooses to embed certain items,
  the client will automatically adapt and 'upgrade' to take advantage of this,
  resulting in less requests.
* Recognizes [`application/problem+json`][3] responses and automatically
  converts them to exceptions.
* Supports Basic auth, Bearer tokens.
* Also implements some of OAuth2, including the `password`,
  `client_credentials` grant types and will automatically refresh expired
  access tokens if a refresh token was provided.
* Supports HTTP `Link:` headers and merges them in with HAL links, allowing
  you to follow links on non-HAL or non-JSON resources.
* Similarly, if given a HTML document it will extract all `<link>` and
  `<a>` tags with `rel=` attributes.

How does it work?
-----------------

Generally with REST you'll want to 'discover' urls based on link relationships,
and not hardcode them. This is the main focus of the API.

The following sample does the following:

1. Create a new client and specify the 'bookmark url' of the API to
   `https://api.example.org`.
2. Find a collection of articles using `rel="articleCollection"`.
3. Grab the first article in that collection (generally items in a collection
   use `rel="item"`. See [RFC6573][4]).
4. Do a `GET` request on the article, and afterwards follow the `rel="author"`
   link.
5. Lastly, change the name of the author by doing a `PUT` request.


```js
const ketting = new Ketting('https://api.example.org');

// Ketting uses a special promise that has a `follow` function so it can be
// chained to do multiple hops.
const articleResource = await ketting.follow('articleCollection').follow('item');
const articleBody = await article.get();

const authorResource = await articleResource.follow('author');
const authorBody = await authorResource.get();

authorBody.name = 'Evert Pot';

await authorResource.put(authorBody);
```

A few notes:

* Any of these hops could have been HTML documents, HAL documents or any
  resource with a `Link` header. Only the last one (author) really had to be
  JSON, because we're parsing it and changing it.
* If any of the followed links appeared in `_embedded`, they're stored in a
  local cache and those HTTP requests would have been skipped.
* Ketting will wait till the last possible moment to do a HTTP request.
  Sometimes it's a bit surprising when the actual HTTP request happens.
  following a link generally does not.

Anyway, I hope this is interesting to other folks! Special thanks to [@mhum][5]
for his significant contributions.

* [Github and documentation][6].
* [Npm package][7].

Some things that might happen for a 2.0 version:

* Total conversion to Typescript. I went from a sceptic to a believer.
* Maybe support for the [SIREN][8] and [Atom][9] format.
