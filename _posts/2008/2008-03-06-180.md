Random notes:

* For IE7 the focus was on security, IE8 = user experience.
* The IE guy is explaining about how interoperability hurts innovation, because
  too much time is lost in fixing those (can't help but getting a big DUH!
  feeling).
* He explains how there's a lot of content on the web, that depends on the
  buggy behaviour of older IE versions.. so there's a challenge to solve. IE8
  will introduce a compatibility mode, a lot of information with big opionion
  pieces from both people who like or hate this can be found on
  [A List Apart][1] Look for version targetting.
* Looks like they created a Firebug-like tool for IE..

HTML 5
------

* Making the back button work, using HTML5 hash function? Can't actually find
  any info on this and I think this can be implemented today?
* HTML Connection events .. very cool, javascript can catch an event if the
  internet connection is gone!

OpenService
-----------

Seems to be about deep browser integration.. Subscribing to Webslices.. Seems
to be a mini i-frame integrated into the toolbar.. Examples are shown of
facebook status updates and Ebay auctions..

To integrate, add the 'hslice' css class to a div.. If you go to [Your facebook
homepage][2], and look at the source, you'll notice there's 'hslice' css
classes.
